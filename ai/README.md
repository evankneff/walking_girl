# AI Reference Directory

This directory contains structured documentation for AI agents working on the Walking Girl project. Use these documents to understand the product, architecture, and conventions when implementing new solutions.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [MVP.md](./MVP.md) | Product overview: what the product does and how applications work together |

## Usage

- **Before implementing features**: Read the MVP and any relevant docs to align with product goals and architecture.
- **When adding new docs**: Keep them in Markdown (`.md`) for portability and easy parsing.
- **When updating**: Keep MVP and architecture docs concise; move detailed specs to separate files if needed.
