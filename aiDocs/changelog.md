## 2026-02-09: Time Entry Privacy & UX

Improved the participant time-entry experience to better protect privacy and make the flow clearer, especially on mobile.

**UI:**

- Obfuscated participant last names in the entry UI while keeping full names in data/admin views
- Replaced the name dropdown with a type-to-filter list of obfuscated names and an explicit selection state
- Updated the post-submission screen to keep stats visible and added a “Bring me back to the dashboard” button
- Added an “I entered it wrong” flow that repopulates the form with the last submitted values and guides users to ask leaders for final corrections
